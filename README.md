# Abstractive-Text-Summarization-with-Transformers
This project builds an end-to-end abstractive text summarization system. It fine-tunes a Transformer model (e.g., T5) on a large news dataset to generate concise summaries. A Gradio UI allows users to input text and get instant, rephrased summaries, showcasing advanced NLP and MLOps skills.
